        <h1>UDAAN</h1>
          <p> Udaan is the annual cultural event of Pratigya where all the students and volunteers of
            Pratigya engage on preparing the students for the event. It includes all kinds of small acts
            like dancing, singing, skit, fancy dress, bhangra and giddha. All of the acts are performed by
            the students and are prepared by the volunteers with help of other socities and/or other
            teachers. This event is the main highlight and best part of the year for us and the students.
            Students who are free from exams and have holidays before the schools start get a good
            training to be more confident and adaptable to stage. Hosting an audience of 500 we make
            it sure that every year is remembered to be the best yet with proper themes fitting just right. <br>
            The event is attended by parents of the kids, our colleagues, faculty of Thapar and Schools.
            We make it sure that each and every kid gets an opportunity to show the talent he or she has.</p>
